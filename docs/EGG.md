# EGG

#### KALE - YOUR ALTERNATIVE INFORMATION SOURCE FOR NUTRITION

EGG is a collective of based individuals who has seen through the lies and turned their back on convential "knowledge" and resorted to set up their own information source.

EGG stands for Enlighted Genuine Growth. Only through having an open mind can members start advancing to the next level of conciousness. Through believe in their own capacity of understanding the world they are able to introspect and gain exceptional knowledge.

### History of EGG
The organisation came into existence in August 1997 in the garage of our leader, after a rigorous band practice, where one of the members fainted. Once he started feeling better we discussed why it happened. It turned out that he hadn't eaten for two days. 

We discovered that even though they only tell us *"You shouldn't skip [breakfast](./BREAKFAST.md)"* and *"breakfast is the most important meal of the day"* It turns out that that all meals are important, not just the breakfast ones. Also it is not just you shouldn't skip breakfast, more you can't. If you just miss one breakfast you already have no food for two full days. It is ridiculous that this isn't talked about more in schools and by the media. 

This is when we decided that we were obligated to ourselves to dispel the myths around food people try to force down our throats.
